**Unit 4: Managing Different Types of Business Negotiations** <span
id="4"></span> 
*In this unit, you will learn about factors that are important for
negotiating in an organizational context.  Business negotiations can
include negotiating your salary, ironing out contracts with your
company’s suppliers, settling contract issues with a labor union, or
negotiating a merger.  You will consider how to negotiate as the
underdog in business-to-business transactions.  Transformational
negotiations can go beyond providing a win–win solution to a problem;
they can help you build alliances.  By the end of this unit, you will no
longer look across the negotiation table and see an adversary; rather,
you will learn to regard your counterpart as a partner engaged in a
collaborative effort in building a long-term strategic alliance.*
