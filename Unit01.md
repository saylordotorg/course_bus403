**Unit 1: What Is Negotiation?** <span id="1"></span> 
*Negotiations (also referred to as “bargaining”) take place in a range
of contexts.  While the objectives of this course focus on business
negotiations, you will learn that negotiation principles apply to a vast
and diverse range of personal, business, and public situations. You
could find yourself negotiating a weekend curfew with your teenager or
perhaps a new home purchase.  In business you might negotiate a
purchasing contract with a supplier, a new project with employees, or a
merger between two major corporations. In the public sector, you might
find yourself in the middle of a negotiation on anything from a new
school board policy, the content of a new bill with your Congressional
representative, or an international trade agreement with China. 
Regardless of the context, the basic principles of negotiation are the
same.  Whether you are involved in a friendly exchange or a high-stakes
conflict resolution, you are essentially in a two-way communication for
the purpose of reaching an agreement.  The same skills that diplomats
use to negotiate international peace agreements will help you become a
more effective business negotiator.*
