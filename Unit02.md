**Unit 2: Negotiation Strategies and Biases** <span id="2"></span> 
*According to the Stanford Graduate School of Business, “Successful
bargaining means looking for positives in every possible circumstance.” 
You cannot accomplish this without careful planning.  The product of the
careful negotiation planning is your negotiation strategy.  The strategy
you use in a negotiation is heavily reliant on the outcome that you
desire.  An understanding of the principles, strategies, and tactics
used by effective negotiators will help you become more confident in
your ability to choose a negotiation strategy that will help you
accomplish your goals.  Perhaps more important than planning an
appropriate strategy is to become knowledgeable about what motivates us
and our counterparts to make decisions.  In this unit, you will learn
about various biases that affect our decision making and how to use this
knowledge to overcome obstacles to clear, objective, and effective
negotiations.  In subsequent units, you will learn how to apply these
concepts to specific negotiation theories in order to add or create
value for all participants to the negotiation.*
