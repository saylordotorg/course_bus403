**Unit 5: Conflict Resolution** <span id="5"></span> 
*Perhaps you feel that conflict is an inevitable part of life.  If you
agree, you are not alone.  Have you have ever driven a car in rush hour
traffic?  Have you ever been faced with an angry customer (or been that
angry customer)?  Are your coworkers or employees less than perfect 100
percent of the time?  Any of these scenarios can result in conflict. 
Unless it is managed properly, conflict can damage an organization and
destroy interpersonal relationships.*  
  
 *In this unit, you will learn how conflict can be a positive influence
if it is managed properly.  In fact, conflict that is effectively
resolved can help personal and professional relationships grow and
strengthen.   You will explore some alternatives to the potential
lose–lose outcome of conflict.  By the end of this unit, you will be
familiar with ways to diagnose conflict and apply new strategies to
solving the problems associated with conflict.*
