**Unit 3: Processes and Phases of Negotiation** <span id="3"></span> 
* As you have progressed through learning materials in Units 1 and 2,
you have learned that regardless of the inevitability of conflict in
your life, you can choose from an array of negotiation approaches to
manage the conflict effectively.  In this unit, you are going to
consider some basic principles from time-tested negotiation theory.  You
will explore both competitive and collaborative negotiation strategies. 
In addition, you will learn about four distinct phases in the
negotiation process and how appropriate implementation of each phase
will lead to effective negotiation.  By the end of this unit, you will
see that you do not always have to settle for your piece of the pie. 
Using a successful negotiation strategy can make the pie bigger for all
concerned.*

     Instructions: Read Spangler’s overview of distributive bargaining,

    discussed in subunit 3.2) will depend on many factors.  In fact,
    sometimes a situation may call for choosing not to participate in a
    negotiation, because the preferred outcome might be achieved by
    simply delegating or walking away.  Please click on any embedded
