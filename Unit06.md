**Unit 6: International and Cross Cultural Negotiation** <span
id="6"></span> 
*Negotiating across national and cultural boundaries raises additional
challenges for participants.  All of us are a product of the culture and
geographical areas in which we were raised and now live.  Culture
creates biases in our perceptions, motivations, interests, and
strategies, which may give rise to a host of conflicts in the
negotiating process.  Aspects of culture that may affect negotiations
include such things as language, dialect, societal norms, business
etiquette, religion, values, cuisine, hygiene, comfort, and personal
preferences.  International negotiations are also often impacted by
historical events, nationalism, legal restrictions, tariffs, geographic
distance, topographic conditions, multilateral alliances, and political
conflicts.*
