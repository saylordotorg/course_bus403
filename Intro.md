Course Syllabus for "BUS403: Negotiations and Conflict Management"
------------------------------------------------------------------

Negotiation refers to the process of interacting in order to advance
individual interests through joint action.  Contrary to what you might
think, negotiations are not confined to the professional world; we often
negotiate in our personal lives.  The principles that guide successful
negotiations in world politics are equally important in the business
world as well as our personal lives.  In fact, almost every transaction
with another individual involves negotiation.  As you will learn in this
course, negotiation, conflict resolution, and relationship management
are complex processes.  Successful practitioners possess and apply a
blend of perceptual, persuasive, analytical, and interpersonal skills
that you will examine carefully in this course. In the ever-changing
environment of modern business, firms start and grow by virtue of
successful negotiations and by developing long-term relationships among
two, three, or more parties involved, either directly or indirectly, in
various business processes.  By the same token, such relationships can
break down due to ineffective negotiating behavior and conflict
management approaches.  Such breakdowns can also occur because of
misunderstandings and misperceptions of the other parties’ positions and
interests. This course will start with the conceptual framework of
negotiations as it applies to all areas of negotiation in both the
public and private sectors.  As the course progresses, you will focus on
business negotiation skills and strategies designed to help you maintain
healthy business relationships.  Specifically, you will learn about the
concepts, processes, strategies, and ethical issues related to
negotiation as well as appropriate conduct in multicultural business
contexts.  You will also learn to better understand the theory,
processes, and practices of negotiation, conflict resolution, and
relationship management so that you can be a more effective negotiator
in a wide variety of situations.  If you take advantage of the
opportunities this course offers, you will be more comfortable and more
productive managing negotiations as well as professional and personal
relationships. You will examine strategies that are effective as well as
those that are not.  If a strategy works, you will determine how well it
works and discuss alternatives to the less effective approaches.   You
will also identify various patterns of negotiation and conflict
resolution in different national and cultural contexts, and you will
gain an understanding of the influence of national and cultural
variations in the decision-making process. By the end of this course,
you will have developed an understanding of the principles, strategies,
and tactics of effective negotiation, conflict resolution, and
relationship management and enhanced your ability to assess the impact
of interpersonal styles, personality, culture, and other variables that
influence negotiation. This course is designed to align with a Thomas
Edison State College TECEP examination. Visit the [TECEP

free, online materials.  However, the course makes primary use of the
following materials:  

-   Negotiation Experts: [Selection of Articles on
    Negotiation](http://www.negotiations.com/articles/)
-   iTunes U: New Jersey Institute of Technology: Professor Naomi
    Rotter’s  [HRM303/306 Lecture

**Requirements for Completion:** To successfully complete this course,
you must work through all resources for each unit in succession.  The
concepts will increase in complexity as you progress through the
course.  The course begins with a basic discussion of foundational
negotiation concepts and culminates in a discussion of complex
international and cross-cultural negotiations.  In addition to the
resources in each unit, you should complete:  

-   Subunit 6.3 Assignment
-   Final Exam

Note that you will only receive an official grade on your final exam.
 However, in order to adequately prepare for this exam, you will need to
work through the resources in each unit and the assignment listed
above.  
    
 In order to “pass” this course, you will need to earn a 70% or higher
on the Final Exam.  
 Your score on the exam will be tabulated as soon as you complete it. 
If you do not pass the exam, you may take it again.  
    
 **Time Commitment: **  This course should take you approximately **80.5
hours** to complete.  Pay close attention to the time advisory for each
unit.  The time advisories show you the time that you should plan for
the completion of each subunit.  It may be useful to take a look at
these time advisories and to determine how much time you have over the
next few weeks to complete each unit, and then to set goals for
yourself.  For example, Unit 1 should take you 6.5 hours.  Perhaps you
can sit down with your calendar and decide to complete subunit 1.1 (a
total of 2.75 hours) on Monday night; subunit 1.2 (a total of 3.75
hours) on Tuesday night; etc.  Please note that these completion times
are estimates.  For example, you may choose to spend more time on a
particular resource to follow a link within a reading that interests
you, or you may view a resource more quickly because some of the
material is familiar to you from other readings.  
    
 **Tips/Suggestions:** The instructions for each resource in this course
provide you with a highlight of key concepts.  Take note that some of
the resources are used for multiple units.  You should bookmark these
resources in your web browser for easy, future reference.  Take
comprehensive notes on the resources for this course; these notes will
serve as a review as you prepare for your Final Exam.  In addition, a
Glossary of Negotiation Terminology link is included below.  This
glossary contains an alphabetized list of frequently used words and
terms in negotiation and will be a convenient reference as you work
through the course.  Click on the link and scroll down to the respective
word or term for a brief definition.
